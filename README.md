## Overview

**ScholarScraper** is a lightweight Python-based tool designed to extract academic publication data directly from **Google Scholar**. It provides a simple interface to search for research papers, collect metadata such as titles, authors, publication years, citation counts, and links, and structure them into a usable format for analysis or integration into larger projects.

This project aims to simplify academic data collection for intelligent information retrieval final exams project in University of Surabaya

## Features

* **Wrtier-based search** – Enter any writer's papers from Google Scholar.
* **Topic-based search** – Enter any topic or keyword to retrieve relevant papers from Google Scholar.
* **Extract structured data** – Automatically fetch and organize paper details:
  * Title
  * Authors
  * Publication year
  * Citation count
  * Source link
* **Export capability** – Save extracted data into CSV or JSON formats for further processing.
* **Lightweight and fast** 

## How It Works

1. The user inputs a search query.
2. ScholarScraper sends a formatted request to Google Scholar’s search results page.
3. It parses the HTML using **Selenium** to extract structured data (titles, authors, citations, etc.).
4. Results are stored in a **Pandas DataFrame**, allowing easy export and analysis.

## Evaluating How Google Scholar's Work
Evaluating google scholar's web page and how the page work is crucial for automation information retrieval. The evaluation can be accessed [here](documentation/evaluate_web_page.md).
## Tech Stack

* **Python 3.13**
* **BeautifulSoup4** – for parsing HTML
* **Requests** – for handling HTTP requests
* **Selenium** – for dynamic content scraping
* **Pandas** – for data organization and export
